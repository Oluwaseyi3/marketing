              <h1>Affiliate Marketing Model - Works like Magic yet very few people know about it...</h1>
              <h4>You might have heard this term before. That is because affiliate marketing is an industry valued at over $300 US Billion. Affiliate marketing is an income model where you make money by selling someone else's product for sometimes upto 90%  commission.</h4>
              <h4>Basically, you get a link that recognizes you brought the visitor and when they buy, you get a cut which can be anything from 40% to as high as 90%. It is a really effective way for complete newbies to make good money online. The main thing is to get sales for the product you are promoting and you get paid a commission for it. For instance, Back in 2018 when Toyin Omotosho began the model, He joined the Business himself to prove to you he wasn't introducing a scam to Nigeria…, In his first 3 days, He picked a product on Instagram marketing, grabbed his affiliate link for that product, and went ahead to post the affiliate link on his Twitter page along with a small talk. For the record, …that small talk is called Copy.

          <h2>As a Copywriter myself I'll show you how it's done don't worry</h2>
          <h4>Back to Toyin, 3 days later, he checked my emails and saw an email from Expertnaire. The email congratulated him that he had just made N25,000 commission from selling that product. This is the email he got.

            There are many people making as much as N1 Million a week with this model just by posting their affiliate links on their Whatsapp status, FB pages, Instagram pages etc
            And you can even take it a step further by running paid adverts.
